## Aim:

To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Algorithm:
1.Select and Compare 2–3 Competitor Apps/Websites

2.Perform Heuristic Evaluation 

3.Analyze and Document Findings

4.Propose and Apply Improvements

## Benefits of My Design

🌟 1. Seamless Multitasking

Users can watch movies and order food simultaneously, eliminating the need to switch between apps. This increases convenience, engagement, and overall satisfaction.

🧩 2. Gestalt Principle – Proximity and Similarity

The layout clearly groups similar elements:

Food categories are clustered together.

Playback controls are neatly aligned.
This creates a visual hierarchy that’s easy for the user to scan and understand.

🧠 3. Reduced Cognitive Load

The minimal design, simple icons, and intuitive navigation help users focus only on key tasks — watching and ordering — without unnecessary distractions or clutter.

🎨 4. Balanced Aesthetic and Functional Harmony

The design uses a split-screen layout, maintaining balance and symmetry. Warm, neutral tones ensure the user’s attention remains on both functional areas without visual strain.

⚡ 5. Enhanced Engagement

By combining entertainment and food ordering, the app keeps users engaged longer. For example, users can place an order when hungry during a movie, increasing in-app time and interaction.

📱 6. Consistency and Familiarity

Both sections (delivery and video) maintain familiar UI patterns from their original apps (Swiggy & MX Player). This ensures no learning curve for users switching to this integrated experience.

🔒 7. Reduced Interaction Friction

The ability to browse, order, and track food without pausing or minimizing the video prevents frustration — aligning with the law of continuity (smooth flow of actions).

💼 8. Business Advantages

This integrated experience opens new possibilities:

Cross-promotion between platforms.

Increased average order value during streaming.

Enhanced brand loyalty through innovative UX.
